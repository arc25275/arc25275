## Hi, I'm arc!

I've had basic coding experience in the past (Basic programming classes, APCSP) and I have loved it since I first started,but I'm trying to work on improving my coding knowledge by getting as much practice as I can. Right now I am working on Discord Bot coding using discord.js and nodejs. I'm also currently a manager at [BuildTheEarth](https://buildtheearth.net), a project focusing on rebuilding the entire earth in Minecraft!

#### Current projects:
* [Logger](https://github.com/arc25275/logger) (WIP) - A discord bot that logs all [discord.js events](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client), for moderation or general logging for servers. 
* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that can keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Example: To keep guidelines or channel-specific rules at the top of the pins)
* [CanvasBot](https://github.com/arc25275/canvasbot) - A shitty first attempt at a bot that used the [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/) [LMS API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) that I gave up on after realizing it was useless
