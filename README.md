## Hi, I'm arc!

I'm a high school senior currently applying to colleges, hoping to get a compsci degree! I love programing, gaming, and right now I am learning how to program games with Unity and C# I'm also currently a discord bot developer at [BuildTheEarth](https://buildtheearth.net), a project focusing on rebuilding the entire earth in Minecraft!

### Experience:
JS / TS / Node — AP Computer Science / Self Taught for more advanced topics. Strongest language.

C++ — College level course

C# / Unity — Self Taught, currently learning

HTML / CSS - AP Computer Science


#### Current projects:

* [main-bot](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/main-bot) - The main bot of the BTE discord server, currently working with a few others to add features and fix any bugs that pop up.
* Untitled game - No code on github yet, but a concept can be seen at https://www.arc25275.dev/game, where the basic concept is a platformer where you are able to switch between the background and foreground.
* [Google Bot](https://github.com/arc25275/google-bot) - A discord bot based around google api, made as a practice for using more complex apis (mostly), and discord.js v13
* [Website](https://arc25275.dev) - Not really anything done yet, but probably info similar to this will be put there, along with other demos and portfolios

#### Future projects:
* Arduino code for my school engineering academy. Projects will be a mini piano as well as a automated robot
* More games probably
* Destiny 2 Tools to help make some things easier (ex: Applying ammo finder mods depending on what weapons are equipped)
#### Finished: 
* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that can keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Example: To keep guidelines or channel-specific rules at the top of the pins)

##### On hold:
* [Logger](https://github.com/arc25275/logger) (WIP) - A discord bot that logs all [discord.js events](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client), for moderation or general logging for servers. Lost motivation as it got pretty repetitive
