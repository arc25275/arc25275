### Current Work:
* [Website](https://arc25275.dev) - Partially done, but probably info similar to this will be put there, along with other demos and portfolios

##### Classes:
* Software Engineering II - Focusing on the verification phase of programming. Version Control, Testing, and Build Systems.
* Operating Systems I - Learning about Operating Systems, using UNIX as a model.


### Finished: 
* [ChatGPT Google Extension](https://github.com/arc25275/chatGPT-google) - Firefox Extension that adds a chatGPT summary to google search, with a customizable prompt.
* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that can keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Example: To keep guidelines or channel-specific rules at the top of the pins)
* [Google Bot](https://github.com/arc25275/google-bot) - A discord bot based around google api, made as a practice for using more complex apis (mostly), and discord.js v13

##### Past Classes 
* [Software Engineering I](https://github.com/arc25275/todo) - General concepts of software engineering lifecycle. Agile and other project management, as well as usability engineering. Ended up using lots of Tkinter for the first time. Focus on [microservices](https://github.com/arc25275/weather_icons).
* [Computer Architecture and Assembly](https://github.com/arc25275/MASM-projects) - Basics of a CISC computer, and learning MASM Assembly programming
* [Fundamentals of Computer Programming](https://github.com/arc25275/fundamentals) - Theory around the concepts of programming, and learning different styles of programming languages like Functional (Elm) or Logical (Prolog)
* [Analysis of Algorithms](https://github.com/arc25275/algorithms) - Learning about different types of algorithms, finding time complexity, determining validity, and writing some as well
* [Web Development](https://github.com/arc25275/MERN-site) - Basics of building a website, with a frontend and backend, using the MERN stack
* Usability Engineering - Learning about different design principles, and how designs can be effectively tested to ensure they work best for everyone.
* Databases - Learning the basics of how SQL works and can be used in combination with a front end.
* [Data Structures](https://github.com/arc25275/data-structures) - Learning about the foundation of how different data strucures are made and work internally, and how to make our own.
