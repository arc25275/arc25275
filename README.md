### Language Experience:
JS / TS / Node — AP Computer Science, Intro to Databases / Self Taught for more advanced topics.

HTML / CSS — AP Computer Science, Web Development class

Python — Work, School (Intro to Python, [Data Structures](https://github.com/arc25275/data-structures), [Analysis of Algorithms](https://github.com/arc25275/algorithms)) (Current Strongest Language)

C — [XV6 Kernel Programming](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2024/xv6/book-riscv-rev4.pdf) - Probably some of the work I'm most proud of yet. Very difficult but rewarding, and good practice in effectively reading large codebases to make small but effective changes.

C++ — College level course, Shell Emulator

C# — Basic Game Dev, Self Taught then by College course

Assembly — ([MASM](https://github.com/arc25275/MASM-Projects))

[Elm, Prolog](https://github.com/arc25275/fundamentals)

Svelte — Venome

SQL — Intro to Databases, Venome

#### Current Classes:
* [Senior Software Project - Unknown Venome](https://github.com/Venom-Biochem-Lab/venome) - 3 Term Team Capstone Project in collaboration with a BioChem professor, focused on cataloguing the proteins related to their Wasp Venom research. Continuing work from previous year.
  
* Operating Systems II - Learning about User-Kernel-Hardware communication and OS Architecture using XV6
  
* Information Visualization - Learning techniques to show data using R and Gephi.


#### Side Projects: 
* [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1869772) - First contribution to Firefox. Started during OSS class and finished later. Added URL options to `about:translations` page for easier saving and loading of translations.

* [Create Astral](https://github.com/arc25275/Create-Astral) - A minecraft modpack that I contributed to in the form of KubeJS files, which can define custom behaviors and interactions between different mods. Worked on refactoring as well as adding new features.

* [Sumo Robot](https://github.com/arc25275/sumo-bot) - Arduino code for a small wheeled robot made in my High School Engineering Academy to fight other robots. Was built from scratch, including PCB Design, 3D Printing and laser cutting, as well as the coding.

* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that can keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Example: To keep guidelines or channel-specific rules at the top of the pins)
  
* [Google Bot](https://github.com/arc25275/google-bot) - A discord bot based around google api, made as a practice for using more complex apis (mostly), and discord.js v13
  
* [BTE Bot](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/main-bot) - A discord bot created for a large (100k person) server, where when contributing to I first experienced and learned about Node, Typescript, and in general more advanced javascript beyond static websites. Built a lot of fundamentals.



#### Past Classes 
* [Software Engineering I](https://github.com/arc25275/todo) - General concepts of software engineering lifecycle. Agile and other project management, as well as usability engineering. Ended up using lots of Tkinter for the first time. Focus on [microservices](https://github.com/arc25275/weather_icons).
  
* [Computer Architecture and Assembly](https://github.com/arc25275/MASM-projects) - Basics of a CISC computer, and learning MASM Assembly programming
  
* [Fundamentals of Computer Programming](https://github.com/arc25275/fundamentals) - Theory around the concepts of programming, how a language is constructed through grammar, and learning different styles of programming languages like Functional (Elm) or Logical (Prolog). One of my favorite classes I've taken, and made me think about programming languages very differently. My favorite example related to this is the [JSON documentation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), and perfectly shows how languages can be broken down into simple peices.
  
* [Analysis of Algorithms](https://github.com/arc25275/algorithms) - Learning about different types of algorithms, finding time complexity, determining validity, and writing some as well
  
* [Web Development](https://github.com/arc25275/MERN-site) - Basics of building a website, with a frontend and backend, using the MERN stack
  
* Usability Engineering - Learning about different design principles, and how designs can be effectively tested to ensure they work best for everyone.
  
* Databases - Learning the basics of how SQL works and can be used in combination with a front end.
  
* [Data Structures](https://github.com/arc25275/data-structures) - Learning about the foundation of how different data strucures are made and work internally, and how to make our own.
  
* Software Engineering II - Focusing on the verification phase of programming. Version Control, Testing, and Build Systems.
  
* Operating Systems I - Learning about Operating Systems, using UNIX as a model. Built our own custom shell to learn about POSIX command line syntax and architecture.
  
* Intro to Computer Graphics - Learning how to create 3D Computer Graphics with OpenGL.
  
* [Mobile Software Development](https://github.com/arc25275/AndroidStudioProjects) - Creating multi-screen and dynamic android apps with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
  
* Open Source Software - Learning about FOSS, and choosing a project to contribute to.
