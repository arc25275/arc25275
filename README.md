## Hi, I'm an stupid fucking idiot!

I've had no coding experience in the past (no Basic programming classes, no APCSP (whatever that is)) and I have hated it since I first started. I'm not trying to work on improving my coding knowledge because I'm lazy. Right now I am working on a bad Discord Bot coding using discord.js and nodejs. I'm also currently a (bad) manager at [BuildTheEarth](https://buildtheearth.net), a project on block game! ([Discord Invite](https://buildtheearth.net/discord)) ([Github Org](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth))

#### Current projects:
* [Logger](https://github.com/arc25275/logger) - A bad discord bot that logs only a few [discord.js events](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client), for moderation or general logging for servers.
* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that tries to keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Examples: none, it's useless)
* [CanvasBot](https://github.com/arc25275/canvasbot) - A really shitty first attempt at a bot that used the [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/) [LMS API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) that I gave up on after realizing it was useless and because I'm lazy
