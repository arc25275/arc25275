#### Current projects:

* [main-bot](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/main-bot) - The main bot of the BTE discord server, currently working with a few others to add features and fix any bugs that pop up.
* Untitled game - No code on github yet, but a concept can be seen at https://www.arc25275.dev/game, where the basic concept is a platformer where you are able to switch between the background and foreground. Art is WIP/Not done or planned at the moment.
* [Website](https://arc25275.dev) - Not really anything done yet, but probably info similar to this will be put there, along with other demos and portfolios

#### Finished: 
* [StickyPin](https://github.com/arc25275/stickypin) - A self hosted discord bot that can keep pins to the top of pin lists in channels (Example: To keep guidelines or channel-specific rules at the top of the pins)
* [Google Bot](https://github.com/arc25275/google-bot) - A discord bot based around google api, made as a practice for using more complex apis (mostly), and discord.js v13

##### On hold:
* [Logger](https://github.com/arc25275/logger) (WIP) - A discord bot that logs all [discord.js events](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client), for moderation or general logging for servers. Lost motivation as it got pretty repetitive
